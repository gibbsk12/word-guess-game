# word-guess-game
This is the third assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we had to create a hangman-style game that would run in the browser and use JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML.

## Getting Started
**Harry Potter and the Magical Word**

A random Harry Potter spell will appear on the screen as a series of underscores. Press any letter to start the game. If the letter pressed is correct, the letter will be displayed as part of the word. If the letter pressed is incorrect, the letter will be shown as previously guessed. You only have 10 incorrect guesses before you lose the game. If you correctly identify all letters in the word, you win! The game will record your wins and losses.
